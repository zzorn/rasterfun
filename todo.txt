List of tweaks to do and bugs to fix for Rasterfun.

NEW robust implementation
=========================

Implementation list:

* Parameters [DONE]
* Preview generation [DONE]
* Preview user interface with panning and zooming, and toggle tiling
  * If no tiling, show each picture separated from others in nice table formation (using table preview arranger?)
  * If tiling, show pictures arranged with custom preview arranger, or random preview arranger if generator doesn't specify any
* Perlin noise effect
* Generator editor ui and parameter property editor ui
* Re-render pictures on parameter changes, show progressbar & stop button, stop previous render if properties changed while rendering
* Undo & redo for property changes and other edits
* Load & save of project (using jaxb)
* Automatically create schema from data classes on build
* Export of image

















OLD Scala implementation
========================

* Float to Double cast error from ClassUtils in scalaprops when editing e.g. solid intensity numberfield.

* Make noise seamless

* After pasting a node, select it

* Separate windows with render preview
** For root node, or selected node
** Specify tasrget texture size
** Save button -> save to selected png file

* Render alpha using see-trhough checkerboard

* amplitude and offset controls to noise

* Context menu on cell: Copy, Paste, Cut, Delete

* Context menu on library: Copy (and remove for user library entry)

* Remove/disable the unintuitive select library, select target -paste system for library entries 

* Add drag support for library nodes to graph nodes -> repalce empty, on others show popup menu  Replace, Add After, Cancel

* Add drag support for graph nodes to graph nodes -> show popup menu  Move here, Copy here, Copy After, Move after, Swap, Cancel

* Add drag support for graph node to library, copy node to the library category

* Add right click menu to library, create new category

* Add automatic saving of the libray when it is modified, save into ~/.rasterfun/library.json or similar.  Automatically load from there on startup

* Add name of parameter node is used as to the bottom edge of the node (into own area?)

== More nodes ==

* Circle

* Block / square

* Tile node

* Voronoi

* Offset / translate


== Low priority ==

* Change title to Rasterfun <version>, set version to 0.1 beta

* Add export / import node in file menu

* Add about dialog with link to homepage etc

* Separate the incoming lines a bit on multi-input nodes

* Better color selector
 
* Clearer name to clamp attribute in blend
** Add description modified to properties that is used in tooltips etc

* Write some camel case -> space separated thingy for the property and node names


== Scalaprops ==
* Include miglayout in exported jar?
* Add copy method to bean
* [DONE] Generalize BeanEditorFactory to type [T] for easier use
